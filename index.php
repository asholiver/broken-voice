                    <p class="c-news--content">I meant to post this instalment of Abhorrent Practices last week, but decided it needed a lot more work. Ah well, it's here now!<br>
                    So, what can you expect? More Teeth and Bones, that's what! Yes, the dice game which will determine whether our rather lovely witch is handed over to the Knights of Endurance finally reaches its climax. Eep!</p>

                    <p>We're keeping an eye on Perrick in this week's instalment of Abhorrent Practices, and he's trying his hand at a game of dice. No big deal there, I suppose, except the fate of our delectable witch Alyss rests on the outcome.
                    No pressure!</p>

                    <p>Remember all that fun Sandrine and Naylor had in the soak house? Well, in the latest instalment of Abhorrent Practices, it's the morning after the night before, and Sandrine is paying the price!<br>
                    If you're thinking of dropping by, please keep your voice down. Her head's feeling a teeny bit fragile this morning!

                    <p>In this week's instalment of Abhorrent Practices our saucy witch and her seven-foot companion finally arrive at the smugglers' compound known as the Drum. And, as it turns out, so does a certain former acquaintance.<br>
                    It's not going to be a happy reunion!</p>
